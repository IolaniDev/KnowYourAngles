# KnowYourAngles
KnowYourAngles is designed to help students in Trigonometry learn the values of the Unit Circle. It selects a random problem and displays it. The user writes their answer in the given space. The answer is made beautiful using [MyScript's Interactive Ink SDK 1.3](https://developer.myscript.com/docs/interactive-ink/1.3/overview/about/), and the result can be used to check if the user's answer is correct.

## Getting started
To download some of the frameworks necessary to run KnowYourAngles, you will need [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).  Detailed instructions are available from [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/installing-git-large-file-storage/).

Additionally, you will need to visit the [MyScript Developer site](https://developer.myscript.com/get-started/ios) to obtain a certificate to use for development/testing purposes.
